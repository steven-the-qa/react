const MyComponent = function() {
  // change code below this line
  return (
    <div>I am a div</div>
  )


  // change code above this line
}

//This is how to create a stateless component, which is to say a component that can receive and render data but cannot track changes to it
//Stateless components can be created using functions like the one above that return either JSX or null
//Function syntax requires their identifiers start with a capital letter
