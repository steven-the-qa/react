const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br />
    <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
    <hr />

//In JSX, all tags can become self-closing even if they have the potential to contain content, which can be useful in rendering
//All tags must be closed in JSX, even when they have a non-closed alternative in HTML, like the <br> tag
