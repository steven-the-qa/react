//This challenge shows how toggle a value in the state object when the class method is called in the render method
//You have to bind 'this' to the method in the constructor object of the componenet so you can access the state object in the class
//Then, using the 'setState' method, you just set the value of the property in State to the opposite of what it was before
//That way, when the method is called in the render method, it'll toggle the Boolean value to the other value
