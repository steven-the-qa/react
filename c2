// write your code here
const JSX = <div>
<h1>H1</h1>
<p>p</p>
<ul>
<li>li</li>
<li>li</li>
<li>li</li>
</ul>

//You can create variables in JSX with more complicated nested HTML, but everything must have one parent wrapper element (div, in this case)
//If you just have a series of sibling elements, with no wrapper, they won't transpile
