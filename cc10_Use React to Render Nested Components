//Here we have an example of how components can be nested within each other!
//Thinking in terms of apps and components is key to getting the most out of React
/* Basically, React allows you to create the building blocks of your application 
and separate the code that makes your UI from the code that makes the application logic */
//Isolating these 2 pieces of UI design helps you more easily create and maintain complex projects
