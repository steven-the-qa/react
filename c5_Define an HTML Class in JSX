const JSX = (
  <div className="myDiv">
    <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
);

//You can't define a class for an HTML element in JSX using the 'class' keyword because Javascript reserves that word
//Instead, use 'className', and for all other naming conventions in JSX, camelCase is prevalent (onClick, etc.)
